Since there is yet no a priori way of knowing which cells contain what mutations in real data, most benchmarking results must be taken from simulated data.
The accuracy of SCarborSNV's approximate phylogeny is first evaluated, as well as the calling accuracy with and without the phylogenetic inference stage of the algorithm.
Furthermore SCarborSNV is compared against the two similar tools Monovar and Sci$\Phi$ on time, precision, recall and F1 score whith various input conditions.

\subsubsection*{Tree accuracy}
Tree edit distance with increasing dropout

\subsubsection*{Phylogenetic inference}
Plot of precision vs recall for initial call and phylo call. Hopefully phylo call increases.

\subsubsection*{Time comparison}
Plot of n cells vs time taken with three tools

\subsubsection*{Site calling accuracy}
Which sites got called correctly

\subsubsection*{Cell calling accuracy}
Which cells were called right

\subsubsection*{Genotyping accuracy}
Which whole genotypes were right
